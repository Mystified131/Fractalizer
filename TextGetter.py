He planned to have the proceeds donated to a new organization called United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa). The non-profit foundation would then provide food and relief aid to starving people in Africa, specifically Ethiopia, where a 1983â€“1985 famine raged. The famine ultimately killed about one million people. Belafontes idea for an American version of Band Aids Do They Know Its Christmas? project in the UK Belafonte also planned to set aside money to help eliminate hunger in the United States of America. He contacted entertainment manager and fellow fundraiser Ken Kragen, who asked his clients Lionel Richie and Kenny Rogers to participate. Kragen and the two musicians agreed to help Belafonte, and in turn, enlisted the cooperation of Stevie Wonder, to add more name value to their project. Quincy Jones was drafted to co-produce the song, taking time out from his work on the film The Color Purple. Jones also telephoned Michael Jackson, who had released the commercially successful Thriller album in 1982, and just concluded a tour with his brothers.Jackson told Richie that he not only wanted to sing the song, but to help write it as well. The songwriting team originally included Wonder, but his time was constrained by his song-writing for the film The Woman in Red. So Jackson and Richie wrote We Are the World themselves at Hayvenhurst, the Jackson family home in Encino, California. They sought to write a song that would be easy to sing and memorable, yet still an anthem. For a week, the two spent every night working on lyrics and melodies in Jacksons bedroom. Jacksons older sister La Toya recounted the process in an interview with the U.S. celebrity news magazine People: Id go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michaels usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them. She also later said that Jackson wrote most of the lyrics but hes never felt it necessary to say that. Richie had recorded two melodies for We Are the World, which Jackson took, adding music and words to the song on the same day. Jackson said, I love working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel knowing. I couldnt wait. I went in and came out the same night with the song completed: drums, piano, strings, and words to the chorus. Jackson then presented his demo to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see the structure of the song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair produced no additional vocals and got no work done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson completed the lyrics and melody of We Are the World within two and a half hours, one night before the songs first recording session."
